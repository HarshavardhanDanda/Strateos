Hello <%= @containers.first.organization.name %>,

Strateos periodically reviews your inventory to monitor your sample
conditions. Samples being actively used in recent runs are stored as per your
instructions. However if more than 3 months have elapsed since the samples were
last used in a run or if your reagents have either dehydrated or expired,
they will be disposed of. If you would like to preserve your samples, they can
be returned to you through the standard return shipment process.

The following containers have not been used in a run for more than 3 months and
hence meet the above criteria:

Container ID      Label          Reason for Discard
<% @containers.each do |container| -%>
<%= container.id %>    <%= container.label %>    Last used: > 3 months
<% end -%>

If you would like to request an extension for your container, please visit the
container's page and click 'Request extension' under container actions.

If you would like any of your containers returned, please visit the container's
page and select 'Ship container' under container actions.

If we do not hear from you within the next 2 weeks, your containers will be
discarded.

Best Regards,

The Strateos Team
